# A Small Note
**\[UPDATE 01.15.22]:** This mod was originally made as an example of how to use my [TalkingCardAPI](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/KellyBetty/TalkingCardAPI/). Talking card support has finally already been merged into the core API (starting at version 2.9.0) and JSON support has been merged into JSONCardLoader (starting at version 2.3.0), so now TalkingCardAPI is no longer needed to use this Opossum card! Thanks everyone for the feedback! <3

# FAQ

**Q:** *"How can I make my own talking cards?"*

**A:** This mod was made entirely with JSON. You can use this mod as an example for reference / as an example if you want to make your own talking cards with [JSONCardLoader](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/MADH95Mods/JSONCardLoader/)!.

If you want to see the `\_talk.jldr2` file for this Opossum card (and all of the other JLDR2 files, for that matter), I have put it all [here](https://github.com/KBMackenzie/InscryptionJSONDump/tree/main/TalkingPossum/JSON).

JSON is very accessible, you should try making your own JSON cards if you haven't already!
