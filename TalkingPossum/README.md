An Inscryption mod that adds an Opossum talking card. This mod doubles as an example of how to use my [TalkingCardAPI](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/KellyBetty/TalkingCardAPI/) mod to make talking cards with JSON.

The talking Opossum card has custom dialogue and a custom voice.

# FAQ

**Q:** *"How can I make my own talking cards?"*
**A:** This mod was made entirely with JSON. The main goal of this mod is to serve as an example of how to make talking cards with JSON with the help of the [JSONLoader](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/MADH95Mods/JSONCardLoader/) mod and my [TalkingCardAPI](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/KellyBetty/TalkingCardAPI/) mod.

JSON is very accessible, you should try making your own JSON cards if you haven't already!
